# API deployment

- Repository: `real-estate-price-prediction`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning`
- Duration: `4 days`
- Deadline: `04/11/2022 16:00` **(code)**
- Team challenge : Solo

## Mission objectives

- Be able to deploy a machine learning model.
- Be able to create an API that can handle a machine learning model.
- Deploy an API to Render with Docker.

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" is really happy about your regression model.
They would like you to create an API to let their web-developers create a website around it.

## Preparation

In any API use case the first thing to decide _(for each route)_, is the **input** and the **output** you want.
We took care of this part.

Here you will work with a web dev team, so you **don't want** to collect your data with an html form.
You want to get data in **JSON format** and to return the data in the same format.

### Input

Your input is:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "area": int,
    "property-type": "APARTMENT" | "HOUSE",
    "rooms-number": int,
    "zip-code": int,
    "land-area": Optional[int],
    "garden": Optional[bool],
    "garden-area": Optional[int],
    "equipped-kitchen": Optional[bool],
    "full-address": Optional[str],
    "swimming-pool": Optional[bool],
    "furnished": Optional[bool],
    "open-fire": Optional[bool],
    "terrace": Optional[bool],
    "terrace-area": Optional[int],
    "facades-number": Optional[int],
    "building-state": Optional[
      "NEW" | "GOOD" | "TO RENOVATE" | "JUST RENOVATED" | "TO REBUILD"
    ]
  }
}
```
**You are not required to use ALL the fields inside your function, but you have to adhere strictly to this input format.**
*You may have to re-train your model but hopefully you should not.*

Don't forget to specify which parameters will be required or not.

### Output

Your output will look like that:

```json
{
  "prediction": Optional[float],
  "status_code": Optional[int]
}
```

Don't forget to provide an error if something went wrong. For more information about that, check the [Fast API documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/) and the [status code list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).


### Must-have features

#### Step 1: Project preparation

- Create a folder to handle your project.
- Create a file `app.py` that will contain the code for your API.
- Create a folder `preprocessing/` that will contain all the code to preprocess your data.
- Create a folder `model/` that will contain your model.
- Create a folder `predict/` that will contain all the code to predict a price.

#### Step 2: Preprocessing pipeline

This python module will contain all the code to preprocess your data. Make sure to think about what will be the format of your data to fit the model.
Also, be sure to know which information HAVE to be there and which one can be empty (NAN).

In the `preprocessing/` folder:

- Create the `cleaning_data.py` file that will contain all the code that will be used to preprocess the data you will receive to predict a new price. (fill the NaN values, handle text data, one-hot encode the caterogical features, normalize the continuous data, etc...).
- This file should contain a function called `preprocess()` that will take a new house's data as input and return those data preprocessed as output.
- If your data doesn't contain the required information, you should return an error to the user.

#### Step 3: Prediction

In the precedent project, you made a ML model to predict the price of a house.

Of course, we don't want to train the model each time we launch the API. Find a way to save your model, and add it to a `models` folder at the root of your project.

In the `predict/` folder:

- Create the `prediction.py` file that will contain all the code used to predict a new house's price.
- Your file should contain a function `predict()` that will take your preprocessed data as an input and return a price as output.

#### Step 4: Create your API

In your `app.py` file, create an API that contains:

- A route at `/` that accept:
  - `GET` request and return `"alive"` if the server is alive.
- A route at `/predict` that accept:
  - `POST` request that receives the data of a house in JSON format.
  - `GET` request returning a string to explain what the `POST` expect (data and format).

#### Step 5: Create a Dockerfile to wrap your API

To deploy your API, you will use Docker.

- Create a Dockerfile that creates an image with:
  - Ubuntu
  - Python 3.10
  - FastApi or Flask
  - All the other dependencies you will need.
  - All the files of your project in an `/app` folder that you will previously create.
- Run your `app.py` file with Python.

#### Step 6: Deploy your Docker image in Render.com

[Render](https://render.com/) will allow you to build your docker container on their server and start it.

You will find more explanation of the process [here](../../5.deployment/4.hosting_services/render.md).

If you have an issue or need more information, the [Render documentation](https://render.com/docs/docker) is well-made!

**WARNING:** [As explained here](../../5.deployment/4.Web_Application), when you deploy on a service like Render, you will not want to expose your API on `localhost` because localhost is only reachable from inside the server. Also, on some services, the port you will deploy on could be dynamic! In this case, they usually provide you with an [environment variable](https://www.askpython.com/python/environment-variables-in-python) that contains the port you can use. (`PORT` on Render)

#### Step 7: Document your API

You will present your API to a group of web developers, so make sure to create a clear README to explain to them where your API is hosted and how to interact with it. Don't forget to mention:

- What routes are available? With which methods?
- What kind of data is expected (How should they be formatted? What is mandatory or not?)
- What is the output of each route in case of success? What is the output in case of error?

You are lucky, FastApi [auto-generate this documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#automatic-docs) for you!


## Deliverables

1. Merge your branch with your `main branch` and make sure your repo is clean
2. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
3. Use Docker to wrap your API.
4. Your API is deployed on Render.
5. You documentation is clear.
